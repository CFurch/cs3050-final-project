Framework for game

from game startup:
- player chooses level (skip at start)
- procgen is called with map data (determines an array representation of the indoor map)
- map setup is called with procgens results as an argument
  - puts tile spaces together, creates room class objects (by passing spawn items)
- all these are done within game setup
-
- player entity is rendered
